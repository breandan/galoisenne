    abstract     = {We present a divide-and-conquer algorithm for parsing context-free languages efficiently. Our algorithm is an instance of Valiant's (1975), who reduced the problem of parsing to matrix multiplications. We show that, while the conquer step of Valiant's is O(n3) in the worst case, it improves to O(logn3), under certain conditions satisfied by many useful inputs. These conditions occur for example in program texts written by humans. The improvement happens because the multiplications involve an overwhelming majority of empty matrices. This result is relevant to modern computing: divide-and-conquer algorithms can be parallelized relatively easily.},

    abstract     = {We describe the first approach to automatically repair bugs in context-free grammars: given a grammar that fails some tests in a given test suite, we iteratively and gradually transform the grammar until it passes all tests. Our core idea is to build on spectrum-based fault localization to identify promising repair sites (i.e., specific positions in rules), and to apply grammar patches at these sites whenever they satisfy explicitly formulated pre-conditions necessary to potentially improve the grammar. We have implemented this approach in the gfixr system, and successfully used it to fix grammars students submitted as homeworks in a compiler engineering course, and to map one Pascal dialect grammar against another dialect. gfixr can be configured to explore the repair space in different ways, and can also take advantage of counterexamples to enable restriction patches that make the grammar less permissive.},

In this context, the effective primary decomposition of a polynomial ideal resp. the effective decomposition of an affine algebraic variety into irreducible components are alternatives to the Kuich-Salomaa elimination algorithm described in [7]. Both here applied decompositions are based on the construction of a Gr\"{o}bner basis of an elimination ideal via Buchberger's algorithm. We reprove then in a constructive way that the generating function of each nonterminal of a context-free grammar is algebraic and also that the generating function of a language, generated by an unambiguous context-free grammar is algebraic (Chomsky-Sch\"{u}tzenberger [4]).},
